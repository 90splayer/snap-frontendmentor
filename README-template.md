### What I learned

I learned the mobile first model, flexbox order, javascript to change images with screen change & how to add dropdowns



```css
.home-image{
        order: 2;
}
```
```js
function openNav() {
    document.querySelector(".wrapper").classList.add("side-panel-open");
}
```



### Continued development

I'd like to work on more responsive webpages and more complex dropdowns
